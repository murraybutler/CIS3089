To run the Bloom Filter and associated functions, please be sure the following is done.

1. remove directories for fresh run:
  remove DDStore/ DDMaps/ bloomLog bloomOut
    -these are the segment and map stores, as well as the log and filter storage

2. run the compile:
  javac BloomFile/*.java

3. run the driver file:
  java BloomFile/bloomDriver
    -the initial run will deduplicate some extents, for further dedup, run again.  
      Deduplicaiton will reach 100%, meaning all extents have been seen and the 
      data is no longer unique.

The files in this directory named test1 through test9 are Lorem Ipsum filled files
of differing lengths, used as the deduplication targets.
